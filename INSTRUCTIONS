Unzip the assignment file into the 'in' directory such that every subdirectory
corresponds to a single submission.

Next, place any extra files needed to compile and test the project into the
'payload' directory. Then modify the Makefile in the 'payload' directory so that
it can correctly compile and test the project.

See 'Makefile-sample' for an example of how to do this with input/output
redirection.

Enjoy!
